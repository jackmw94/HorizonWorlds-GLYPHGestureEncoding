Gesture creation tool for the GLYPH gesture system for Horizon Worlds, used to detect more complex gestures the player makes when in focus mode.

The system works in 2 parts:
* This tool is used to define, name, edit and test gestures
* GLYPH asset in Horizon then decodes players' gestures and sends out an event with the gesture's name
  
This repository contains the first part - the gesture creation tool.

To download the gesture creation tool application, see the "Releases" section to the right of this panel. 

Here is a video showing a runthrough of how to use this:
